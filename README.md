# Bayesian Cluster Analysis: Point Estimation and Credible Balls  

## Project Overview  
This project applies Bayesian cluster analysis, inspired by the methodology presented in the paper *"Bayesian cluster analysis: Point estimation and credible balls"*. The objective is to analyze a clustering problem using Bayesian techniques, with real or simulated data, to understand uncertainty in cluster assignments while leveraging advanced statistical methods.  

## Project Goals  
1. **Define the Problem**: Clearly outline the clustering problem and its significance.  
2. **Apply Bayesian Techniques**: Use appropriate Bayesian methods seen in class to analyze the problem.  
3. **Methodology Explanation**: Explain the Bayesian technique selected, its motivation, and its relation to the problem.  
4. **Computational Implementation**: Describe the computational methods used and challenges encountered.  
5. **Interpret the Results**: Present and interpret the findings, comparing them to results obtained via a frequentist approach.  


## Project Structure  
A runnable R markdown "BayesianClusterAnalysis" with all the necessary descriptions.

## Deliverables  
- **Final Report**: A detailed document covering the problem definition, methodology, computational details, results, and comparisons.  
- **Codebase**: A fully reproducible set of scripts in Python/R for data analysis and visualization.  
- **Due Date**: January 25th, 2025.
